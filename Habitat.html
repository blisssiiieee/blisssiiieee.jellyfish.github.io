                <h2><strong>ABOUT</strong></h2>
                <p>Named after the Greek word for "sea nettle," cnidarians are marine animals characterized by their jelly-like bodies, their radial symmetry, and their "cnidocytes"—cells on their tentacles that literally explode when stimulated by prey. There are about 10,000 cnidarian species, roughly half of which are anthozoans (a family that includes corals and sea anemones); the other half are scyphozoans, cubozoans, and hydrozoans (what most people refer to when they use the word "jellyfish"). Cnidarians are among the oldest animals on earth: Their fossil record stretches back for almost 600 million years.</p>
                <p>Jellyfish come in a wide variety of shapes and sizes. The largest is the lion's mane jellyfish (Cyanea capillata), which can have a bell over six and a half feet in diameter and weigh up to 440 pounds; the smallest is the Irukandji jellyfish, several species of dangerous jellyfishes found in tropical waters, which measure only about two-tenths of an inch and weigh well under a tenth of an ounce.</p>
                <p>Jellyfish lack a central nervous system, a circulatory system, and a respiratory system. Compared to vertebrate animals, they are extremely simple organisms, characterized mainly by their undulating bells (which contain their stomachs) and their dangling, cnidocyte-spangled tentacles. Their nearly organless bodies consist of just three layers—the outer epidermis, the middle mesoglea, and the inner gastrodermis. Water makes up 95 to 98 percent of their total bulk, compared to about 60 percent for the average human being.</p>

                <h3><strong>Defenses</strong></h3>
                <p>The tentacles, with their stinging cells, serve as defense and as a powerful weapon for capturing prey. When they come into contact with their victims, the nematocysts (cells loaded with poison) present in the tentacles release their harpoons or filaments and release a toxic substance that paralyses the prey. The oral arms help in the capture and ingestion of the captured animal.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="text-box">
                <h3><strong>Jellyfish Movement</strong></h3>
                <p>One of the most observable behaviors of many species of jellyfish is the pulsation of the swimming bell. Pulsations are coordinated by nerve centers along the outside of the bell. Most jellyfish have groups of cells able to contract in length and are considered simple muscles. Ones on the underside of the bodies can contract but not expand, allowing it to swim. Constant movements also facilitate oxygen exchange, which occurs over the jelly's entire body surface.Regardless of their means of propulsion, most jellyfish just drift with the current. Most large jellyfish spend their time swimming about freely. Some smaller ones spend much of their lives living as attached polyps. Some comb jellies have comb-like paddles comprised of cilia.</p>

                <h3><strong>Jellyfish Stingers and Toxins</strong></h3>

                <p>All true jellyfish sting with tinging cells called nematocysts, which are there to deter potential predators and help catch prey. The venom, which humans only feel if it penetrates their skin, is injected with millions of microscopic barbs, coiled like springs and fired by touch or chemicals. The toxin immobilizes prey by disrupting the transmission of information between the synapses of the prey's nerve cells. The prey is digested by cells in a primitive stomach. When used as protection from predators, the toxin is automatically discharged when jellyfish bump into something warm — like another sea creature — from poison-containing stingers in mantles, arms or long threadlike tendrils which can grow to one meters long.</p>

            <div class="text-box">
                <h3><strong>Bioluminescence</strong></h3>
                <img src="../Images/Jellyfish bg.jpg" alt="Sea Nettle (Chrysaora fuscescens)" class="text-box-img">
                <p>Rare among plants and animals that live on land, the ability to generate light is much more common underwater, where three quarters of the living beings are bioluminescent. These organisms produce their own glow as a tool to attack, defend or mate, creating a unique spectacle of radiant colours.</p>
                <p>It is estimated that about 50% of jellyfish are bioluminescent. There are many different types represented, including siphonophores (related to the Portuguese man-o-war), medusae, sea pens and other soft corals, and ctenophores (comb jellies). The greatest diversity of luminescent jellyfish occurs in the deep sea, where just about every kind of jellyfish is luminescent. Most jellyfish bioluminescence is used for defense against predators. Jellyfish such as comb jellies produce bright flashes to startle a predator, others such as siphonophores can produce a chain of light or release thousands of glowing particles into the water as a mimic of small plankton to confuse the predator. Others produce a glowing slime that can stick to a potential predator and make it vulnerable to its predators. Some jellyfish can release their tentacles as glowing decoys. So you see that there are many strategies for using bioluminescence by jellyfish.</p>

            <h2 id = "threats"><strong>THREATS</strong></h2>
            <p>Jellyfish are prey for sea turtles, crabs, fish, dolphins, and terrestrial animals: There are some 124 fish species and 34 other species that are reported to feed either occasionally or mainly on jellyfish. Jellyfish often establish symbiotic or parasitic relationships with other species—the parasitic ones are almost always detrimental to the jellyfish.Many species—sea anemones, brittle stars, gooseneck barnacles, lobster larvae and fish—hitch rides on jellyfish, finding safety from predators in the folds. Octopuses are known to use jellyfish tentacle fragments on sucker arms as added defensive/offensive weaponry, and dolphins tend to treat some species like underwater frisbees. Jellyfish have been considered a delicacy for human diets since at least 300 CE in China. Today, fisheries raising jellyfish for food exist in 15 countries. </p>

            <p>But jellyfish may have the last laugh. Far from being a threatened species, jellyfish are on the increase, moving into habitats that have been damaged or destroyed for other marine creatures. Increased blooms can have negative impacts on human economic activities, clogging cooling water intakes at coastal power plants, bursting fishing nets and contaminating catches, killing off fish farms, reducing commercial fish abundance through competition, and interfering with fisheries and tourism. The primary causes for habitat destruction are human over-fishing and climate change, so the reason for the uptick in jellyfish blooms can be assigned to human interference.</p>

                <p>Jellyfish are carnivores and can increase in size rapidly and procreate in large numbers when food is abundant. However, if food is scarce, they can become smaller. These animals, of a gelatinous consistency, have a very unsophisticated anatomy which is nevertheless very effective. They feed mainly on zooplankton, small crustaceans, and in some cases, small fish and other jellyfish also form part of their diet. It is a strange sight to see the jellyfish’s latest prey inside its body before it is digested.</p>

It is a strange sight to see the jellyfish’s latest prey inside its body before it is digested.</p>
                <p>Jellyfish spend all of their time seeking food, escaping predators, or finding a mate—some set a trap with their tentacles arranged in a spiral pattern, creating an impenetrable curtain for their prey, or array their tentacles in a big field around their bodies. Others simply drift or swim slowly, dragging their tentacles behind them like a trawler net.</p>
                <p>Some species are pleustonic, meaning they live at the air/water interface year-round. Those include the sailing jellies, like the Portuguese man-of-war, the Blue Bottle, and the By-the-Wind Sailor Jelly (Velella velella), which has an oblong blue raft and a silvery vertical sail.</p>
                <p>Like most invertebrate animals, jellyfish have very short lifespans: Some small species live for only a few hours, while the largest varieties, like the lion's mane jellyfish, may survive for a few years. Controversially, one Japanese scientist claims that the jellyfish species Turritopsis dornii is effectively immortal: Full-grown individuals have the ability to revert back to the polyp stage, and thus, theoretically, can cycle endlessly from adult to juvenile form. Unfortunately, this behavior has only been observed in the laboratory, and T. dornii can easily die in many other ways (such as being eaten by predators or washing up on the beach).</p>

However, all of the various species occupy marine, or saltwater habitats and some range into brackish waters. None of the species live in freshwater.</p>
