            <p>Adult jellyfish take the form of a medusa. This is the animal with a bell-shaped body and tendrils which hand down from it. The bell is the main body of the jellyfish and it is so-called due to its appearance. It is umbrella shaped, although it fluctuates when swimming. For this reason, it is sometimes known as a hood since it is malleable like the hood of a cloak.</p>
            <p>The part of a jellyfish known as the bell has a gelatinous consistency. This is thanks to a tissue known as mesoglea. it is generally transparent, although it may be brown, purple or even patterned in various ways. Some species can even be bioluminescent, meaning they are animals that produce their own light. Learn more about this ability in animals with our article on how fireflies produce light.</p>

            <h3 id="tentacles">TENTACLES</h3>
            <p>Jellyfish tentacles are extensions that hang downwards from the bell. They are one of the most indicative parts of a jellyfish, although all other cnidarians have them to varying degrees. Those closest to the mouth are the aforementioned oral arms. They are thicker and shorter in appearance than the other types of jellyfish tentacles.</p>
            <p>The thinnest and longest tentacles are at the ends of the bell. They are often called stinging tentacles. In many types of jellyfish species they can be extremely long compared to the body. This increases the probability of catching more prey due to the area they cover.</p>
            <p>The skin of the tentacles is covered by stinging cells called cnidocytes. These have a spine-like structure called cnidocilium, which activates the cnidocyte upon contact with any external object. This is when a barb is uncoiled from the cell to puncture and inject venom. The potency of the veonom varies depending on the species. </p>
            <p>The oral tentacles serve to attract the prey to the mouth and paralyze it completely. This is in addition to the fact that near the gastric cavity they secrete enzymes to digest the food. The stings serve to both capture their own prey and as a defense against becoming prey themselves.</p>

            <p>The rhopalia can be found at the edge of the part of a jellyfish anatomy known as the bell. They have a sensory function. They consist of an ocellus that serves to detect changes in the surrounding light, as well as a statocyst that serves as a balance organ. This allows the jellyfish to orient itself, especially in terms of sea depth. The level of specialization of the ocellus depends on the species, with box jellyfish such as the sea wasp having the most advanced ocelli.</p>

                    <h3 id = "1">STAGE 1: THE EGG</h3>
                    <p>The jellyfish life cycle begins similarly to our own: a male and a female searching for an opportunity to mate. Adult jellyfish, also known as Medusae, congregate in large numbers at twilight or dusk to reproduce. As a result, they spew copious quantities of sperm and unfertilized eggs into the water surrounding them. </p>
                    <p>These spawning activities continue throughout the adult jellyfish life cycle and are brought on by factors such as proximity to other jellyfish, light, and a large food supply. How much offspring an adult jelly can produce during this period depends on how big it grows. </p>
                    <p>Most jellyfish leave fertilized eggs to float freely on the ocean, while some jellies go to greater lengths to protect their eggs. Moon jellies, for instance, permit the fertilized eggs to stick to their oral arms and provide protection for them until they are prepared to survive the next stage of the jellyfish life cycle.</p>

                    <p>After the eggs of the female jellyfish are fertilized by the male's sperm, they undergo the embryonic development typical of all animals. They soon hatch, and free-swimming "planula" larvae emerge from the female's mouth or brood pouch and set out on their own. A planula is a tiny oval structure the outer layer of which is lined with minute hairs called cilia, which beat together to propel the larva through the water.The planula larva floats for a few days on the surface of the water; if it isn't eaten by predators, it soon drops down to settle on a solid substrate and begin its development into a polyp.</p>

                    <p>After settling to the sea floor, the planula larva attaches itself to a hard surface and transforms into a polyp (also known as a scyphistoma), a cylindrical, stalk-like structure. At the base of the polyp is a disc that adheres to the substrate, and at its top is a mouth opening surrounded by small tentacles. The polyp feeds by drawing food into its mouth, and as it grows it begins to bud new polyps from its trunk, forming a polyp hydroid colony in which the individual polyps are linked together by feeding tubes. When the polyps reach the appropriate size (which can take several years), they begin the next stage in the jellyfish life cycle.</p>

                    <p>When conditions are right, the polyp starts duplicating itself to reproduce asexually. The polyp stretches out and develops segments that will eventually bud off to create separate animals or even more polyps to hasten this process. The polyp that is strobilating is referred to as a scyphistoma, and the process is known as strobilation. The polyp’s tentacles are reabsorbed into its body to begin strobilation.</p>
                    <p>The body of the polyp gets smaller and starts to produce easily seen segments. A fully distinct set of muscles, nerves, and the digestive system eventually split from these segments when the grooves between them grew deep enough.</p>

It’s important to note that while this general outline applies broadly across most species of jellyfish, there are variations based on specific environmental conditions and species characteristics. For instance, some types of jellyfish skip certain stages or have additional ones based on their unique genetic makeup and habitat needs.</p>
